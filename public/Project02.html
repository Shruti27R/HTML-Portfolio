   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>Little Chef is an educational board game designed for 
    children aged 8 years and older, offering a fun learning 
    experience about different foods and nutrition.</p>
    <h3>Project Context</h3>
    <p>Our business project involved developing an educational 
        board/card game for kids. Our team of five conducted individual 
        research on existing games and collaborated on brainstorming sessions. 
        We decided to create a game that teaches children about foods and nutrition, 
        aiming to educate in a fun way while promoting social skills and strategic thinking.</p>
