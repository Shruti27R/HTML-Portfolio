<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a result-driven UX Designer with over 7 years of experience in the design industry. 
  I specialize in blending user-centric insights with design principles to create captivating interfaces 
  that elevate user satisfaction while achieving strategic business goals.</p>

  <h3>For me, UX Design is about crafting purposeful, inclusive human-centered experiences that help people. I believe it's not just 
    about what we do, but what we inspire and enable others to do.</h3>

<p>I see myself as an explorer and a kinesthetic learner, always eager to discover new places and things, 
  and to live in the moment. This adventurous spirit guided my career transition from textile and graphic design 
  to user experience design, driven by my desire to creatively solve everyday user problems. Challenges are opportunities 
  for growth and innovation to me.</p>

<p>My background in graphic and textile design gave me a deep understanding of design processes, product lifecycles, 
  and a keen eye for colors and graphics. This diverse skill set has greatly supported my user experience design endeavors.</p>

<p>I'm also learning coding, and I designed and coded this website from scratch, showcasing my dedication to continuous learning 
  and growth with industry trends.</p>
