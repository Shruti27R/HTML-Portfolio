<h3>Project Context</h3>
<p>There has been a surge in discussions about emotional spending lately, 
    with conversations taking place on social media platforms and even 
    documentaries on OTT platforms focusing on promoting minimalism and rational 
    purchasing. In my thesis, I aim to delve into this specific user segment and 
    explore the underlying reasons behind their behavior. </p>
    <p><strong>I will investigate their 
    challenges, identify their needs, and propose strategies and solutions to address
     them effectively.</strong></p>

     <h3>Process</h3>
     <p>Followed the double diamond design process aligned with the principles of HCDI. 
        By empathizing with users and delving into the underlying causes of their problems, 
        I gained valuable insights. Throughout the process, I prioritized user input and brainstormed 
        potential solutions. Eventually, I created a detailed prototype and conducted usability tests and 
        pretotype experiments to gather feedback and refine the solution.</p>
